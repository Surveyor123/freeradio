	addon_description=_("""FreeRadio is an internet radio, podcast, and audio-book add-on for NVDA that provides seamless access to thousands of internet radio stations via the Radio Browser open directory, RSS/Atom podcast feeds, and the libriVox + GETEM digital library for the visually impaired. It features a fully accessible station browser with search, country filter, favourites management, and per-station, per-podcast, and per-audio-book audio profiles. Podcast episodes and audio book chapters resume automatically from where you left off, with adjustable pitch-preserving playback speed. Playback is handled by BASS, with support for volume control, audio effects, output device selection, and simultaneous audio mirroring to a second device. Additional features include instant and scheduled recording, time-shift rewind of live radio, sleep and alarm timers, automatic ICY metadata announcements, Shazam-based music recognition, and a liked-songs log with lyrics lookup. All controls and shortcuts are designed for NVDA accessibility."""),

- Podcast episode list rows no longer show the publish date (it's still available in the episode details box).
