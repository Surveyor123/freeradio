	addon_description=_("""FreeRadio is an internet radio add-on for NVDA that provides seamless access to thousands of stations via the Radio Browser open directory. It features a fully accessible station browser with search, country filter, favourites management, and per-station audio profiles. Playback is handled by a prioritised backend chain (BASS, VLC, PotPlayer, Windows Media Player) with support for volume control, audio effects, output device selection, and simultaneous audio mirroring to a second device. Additional features include instant and scheduled recording, sleep and alarm timers, automatic ICY metadata announcements, Shazam-based music recognition, and a liked-songs log. All controls and shortcuts are designed for NVDA accessibility."""),

**Added**
- Search results now include **TuneIn** and **iHeartRadio** stations alongside Radio Browser — both sources are queried in the background and merged into the existing result list; the source is shown next to the station name ("... - TuneIn" / "... - iHeart").
- **Selectable recording output format**: keep the original stream format, extract audio losslessly, or convert to MP3 at a chosen bitrate (96–320 kb/s, default 128). Conversion runs in the background; if it fails, the original recording is kept. (#21, contributed by @michalkasperczak)
- **On-demand, accessible output device picker**: opened with `F11` (unbound by default, customizable via NVDA's input gestures settings), pre-selects the currently active device, applies the choice on Enter. Only appears when more than one physical output device is detected — stays out of the way with a single device. (#22, contributed by @michalkasperczak)
**Notes**
- iHeartRadio integration may not work on some networks/regions (e.g. where the provider restricts access at the ISP level); it fails silently in that case without affecting other sources.
